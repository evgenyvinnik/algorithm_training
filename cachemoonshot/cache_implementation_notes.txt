Introduction

The task was to implement cache that is entirely in memory.


Design Principles

I have decided that main class should expose only three public methods (besides constructor):

- PutValue: puts key/value pair in the cache. Invalidating/evicting old entries as needed.

- TryGetValue: attempt to get a value by the provided key.
               I say attempt because if there is no valid entry exist in the cache an attempt to get value from the main store
               and inserting it into a corresponding store would be taken.

- DeleteValue: deletion of value from the cache initiated by the user
               (in addition we have cache entries deletions because of eviction and replacement (new value for existing key))



We have three major classes in the Cache library:

- Cache: class that contains public faced methods, and operates with Cache Dictionaries (aka Cache sets).
         It also calculates hashes from the provided keys to determine in which set to put the cache entry.
         Plus user can subscribe for cache miss and cache eviction listeners.

- CacheDictionary: de-facto main class of the whole implementation.
                   I have decided to go with it being Dictionary based because this data structure provides some
                   nice properties like O(1) key search on average.

- Entry: class to store cache entry key/value pair. Has information about last access time which could be used by eviction algorithms.


Approaching the eviction algorithms we have set a requirement for them to return one entry to evict as a must.
This way we always have some space to add new value into the cache.
